    "in New York City. The dataset is available at the following link: <https://github.com/dbdmg/data-science-lab/raw/master/datasets/NYC_POIs.zip>\n",
    "- **IRIS** dataset: a dataset containing the measurements of the sepal and petal of 150 iris flowers (already introduced in previous laboratories).\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.2.1 New York Point Of Interest dataset\n",
    "In the zip file above you will find three files:\n",
    "- 'pois_all_info': the main dataset file containing the list of all the POIs in New York City. It is provided in TSV (Tab Separated Values) format. This format is very similar to the CSV one, the only difference is the separator used to split the fields in a row: here it is a TAB character\n",
    "- 'ny_municipality_pois_id.csv': a file containing the list of the POIs belonging to the New York City municipality only. It is provided in the CSV format.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the first file you will find the New York Point Of Interest dataset which collects a sub-sample of the point of interests (POI) available in the city of New York.

There are four possible categories of POIs: amenity, shop, public_transport and highway.\n",
    "The fields available in the dataset are the following:\n",
    "- **@id**: the unique identifier of the POI;\n",
    "- **@lat**: the latitude coordinate of the POI in decimal degrees;\n",

    "- **shop**: if the POI category is shop its type is reported in this field;\n",
    "- **public_transport**: if the POI category is public_transport its type is reported in this field;\n",
    "- **highway**: if the POI category is highway its type is reported in this field.\n",
